the work performed to learn the git and github


1->create a central repository on github
2-> create a simple folder in  local machine and open git bash there
4-> git init is the first command for initialize the git
3-> connect the local repossitory(folder) to the remote repository using this command

	 git remote add origin "git remote repository link"
	 
4-> puu the record from the central repository using this command
	
	 git pull origin master
	 
5-> add the wordone.txt file in local repository(index)
6-> use the command for the status of the index files
		
	 git status
	 
	 that shows that workdone.txt is untracked filesnthat means it is on folder but not 
	 added to the local repository so we have to add it first
	 
7-> git add workdone.txt

8-> then we have to commit the file in local repository using this command

	git commmit -m "this is the first commit to the local repository
	
9-> then we created 2 other files like wd2 and wd3 in our folder and use command git status

10-> add all the files and folder in the local repository using this command
  
     git add -A
	 
11-> add all the files in local repository(index) using

	git commit -a -m "add onother 2 files"
