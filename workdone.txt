the work performed to learn the git and github


1->create a central repository on github
2-> create a simple folder in  local machine and open git bash there
4-> git init is the first command for initialize the git
3-> connect the local repossitory(folder) to the remote repository using this command

	 git remote add origin "git remote repository link"
	 
4-> puu the record from the central repository using this command
	
	 git pull origin master
	 
5-> add the wordone.txt file in local repository(index)
6-> use the command for the status of the index files
		
	 git status
	 
	 that shows that workdone.txt is untracked filesnthat means it is on folder but not 
	 added to the local repository so we have to add it first
	 
7-> git add workdone.txt

8-> then we have to commit the file in local repository using this command

	git commmit -m "this is the first commit to the local repository
	
9-> then we created 2 other files like wd2 and wd3 in our folder and use command git status

10-> add all the files and folder in the local repository using this command
  
     git add -A
	 
11-> add all the files in local repository(index) using

	git commit -a -m "add onother 2 files"
	
12-> to create a new branch called firstbranch using this command

	git branch firstbranch
	
13-> to go to firstbranch or change the branch use this command

	gii checkout firstbranch
	
14-> in firstbranch we create a file wd4 and add and commit to the firstbranch 
15-> we can see all the files in the branch using "ls" command 

		so in firstbranch we saw all the files including wd4.txt but in master branch 
			we can see al the files except wd4.txt because it is created in firstbranch only
			
16-> we used the merge command for the merginf the branch for different functionalities and some
		thing like that so here we merge the firstbranch to the master branch and for that 
		we have to mergefirst branch to master so we have to go in the maste branch and command
		are like that
		
		git checkout master
		git merge firstbranch
		
		and now we can see the wd4.txt which is created in firstbranch also seen in the master
		branch using ls coomand we can see it
		
17->  git pull   = = git fetch + git merge

	pull ->get all the new and modified files to the master branch
	fetch - > get all the new and modified files in the new branch so we have to merge that branch
			 with the master branch
			 
18-> we created wd5 and wd6.txt in the firstbranch and add and commit to the local repository 
		with the messaage of the "adding for rebase"
		
		git rebase firstbranch
		
		it is same as merge just it done work in linear way 
		
		now we can see wd5 and wd6.txt in master branch also because of rebase because it is 
		same as merge

19-> we create a ssh key for the ssh request so no one can push iin this repository
		
		ssh-keygen
		
		we can see the ssh key using this command
			
			cat  /c/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	
		and go to setting and in setting ssh and gps key -> add the ssh key and then use command 
		to authenticate us from github 
		
		ssh -T git@github.com
20->
			
		now we want that out all data of firstbranch is also available in central repository so we
		go to the firstbranch and use this command
		
		git push origin firstbranch
		
21->   same command for the push the code in master branch also 
		
		git push origin master
